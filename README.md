### Description	:
"Images for works/assets created under MahatmaGandhi NREGS are captured. Pics are majorlybeing uploaded through Mobile App havingtimestamp & geo tagged data. An automatedsolution (including Deep learning, imageprocessing algorithms, AI algorithms etc.) isneeded which is able to automatically identify the type of image (preferred 3D capture),classify and segment, validate and categorise nature of image, identify the object, defineboundaries etc., highlight duplicates(Plagiarism), invalid pics etc. A software may bedeveloped which at time of photo capture is ableto capture, analyse and classify pixels, read text(OCR, Google lens etc.) and help in definingtype. Would be helpful if it is able to calculatelength, breadth, width (depth) etc. also. A holisticsolution (Automation) is required which can helpaddress these gaps, simplify the process andprovide better results."
